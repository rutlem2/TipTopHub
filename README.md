This repo hosts the **frontend** and backend (**tiptophub**) of an app that allows users to order  
simulated items from real restaurants based on the types of food served at the restaurant.  

Once you enter a valid US zipcode, you will be shown the top 5 restaurants in that area.  
Add your simulated items to your cart, enter your details, and place your 'fake' order!    

Built with React.js, Django, Python, and Yelp.
