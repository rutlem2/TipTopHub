This repo hosts the **frontend** and backend (**tiptophub**) of an app that allows users to order  
simulated items from real restaurants based on the types of food served at the restaurant.  
Simply enter a zipcode, browse the top 5 restaurants provided, and place your (fake) order!  

Built with React.js and Django.
